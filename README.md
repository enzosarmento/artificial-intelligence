# Artificial Intelligence Studies

This repository serves as a personal collection of studies, projects, and notes related to the field of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. It includes materials from courses, books, and personal implementations of various algorithms.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

-   **/books**: Contains PDF versions of relevant books on Artificial Intelligence for reference.

-   **/mit/introtodeeplearning**: Includes notebooks and materials from MIT's "Introduction to Deep Learning" course.

-   **/numpy_ultraquick**: A Jupyter notebook providing a quick and practical tutorial on the NumPy library.

-   **/pandas_dataframe_ultraquick**: A Jupyter notebook offering a concise tutorial on using Pandas DataFrames.

-   **/redes_neurais_artificiais_para_engenharia**: (Portuguese for "Artificial Neural Networks for Engineering") This section is dedicated to the study and implementation of neural networks.
    -   `/book`: The reference book for this section.
    -   `/data`: CSV files used for the examples and projects.
    -   `/perceptron`: Contains a Python implementation of the Perceptron algorithm from scratch.

## Getting Started

Most of the projects and tutorials are in the form of Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`). To run them, you will need to have Python and Jupyter installed.

You can install the required dependencies for each project, which are usually listed within the notebooks themselves or in a `requirements.txt` file. It is recommended to use a virtual environment for each project directory.
